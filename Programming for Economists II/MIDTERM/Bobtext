I met bHelloBob at the park yesterday, he seemed quite happy.
There was another guy named bCrazyBob who joined us later.
Oh, and don’t forget about bOldBob, he’s always there feeding ducks.
Sometimes, bYoungBob comes along, though he’s always late.
We even saw bBigBob once; he was hard to miss!
My friend mentioned bLittleBob, but I haven't seen him myself.
Did you hear about bFastBob? He ran the marathon last week.
bTallBob bumped his head on a tree branch last time.
bSleepyBob fell asleep on the bench while we were talking.
Finally, bHappyBob brought cookies for everyone – what a legend!
